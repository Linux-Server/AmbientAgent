Instead of classical bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can be 0, 1, or both at the same time (a property called superposition).\\n\\nKey ideas:\\n- Superposition: A qubit can encode more information than a classical bit because it can be in a mix of 0 and 1.\\n- Entanglement: Qubits can become correlated in ways that link their states, so the state of one qubit can depend on another, even when far apart.\\n- Interference: The quantum state can interfere constructively or destructively to amplify correct answers and cancel out wrong ones.\\n- Quantum gates: Operations that change the state of qubits, similar to logical gates in classical computers, but acting on superpositions.\\n- Measurement: When you read the result, the qubits collapse to definite 0s or 1s.\\n\\nHow it differs from classical computing:\\n- Quantum computers exploit superposition and entanglement to explore many possibilities in parallel.\\n- They don’t magically solve all problems faster; they provide speedups for specific types of tasks.\\n\\nWhat quantum computers can do particularly well (in principle):\\n- Shor’s algorithm for factoring large numbers (which could impact cryptography).\\n- Grover’s algorithm for faster search in unsorted databases (quadratic speedup).\\n- Simulating quantum systems, which is hard for classical computers but natural for quantum ones (useful in chemistry and materials science).\\n- Some optimization problems and certain machine-learning tasks, under active research.\\n\\nCurrent state and challenges:\\n- We are in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era: devices have tens to a few hundred qubits but are noisy and not yet fault-tolerant.\\n- Major challenges include quantum error correction, reducing errors (decoherence), and scaling up qubit counts in a reliable way.\\n- There are several hardware approaches (including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems), but no universal, fault-tolerant quantum computer yet.\\n\\nIn short, quantum computing is a fundamentally new way of processing information that could solve certain problems more efficiently than classical computers, but it’s still in early stages and best suited for niche applications for now.

In steady flight, the lift balances weight and thrust balances drag.\\n\\nKey parts of the idea\\n\\n- Lift from the wings:\\n  - Airfoil shape (curved on top, flatter on the bottom) makes air move faster over the top than the bottom.\\n  - Faster air on top lowers pressure, and the difference in pressure pushes the wing upward.\\n  - The wing also deflects air downward, and by Newton’s third law the plane gets an upward push.\\n  - Lift depends on speed, wing area, air density, and the wing’s angle of attack (how much the nose is tilted up).\\n\\n- Thrust and drag:\\n  - Engines provide forward thrust to move the plane through the air.\\n  - Drag is the air resistance that slows the plane; thrust must overcome it for level flight or to accelerate.\\n\\n- The four forces in flight:\\n  - Lift (up) vs. Weight (down)\\n  - Thrust (forward) vs. Drag (backward)\\n  - In level flight, Lift ≈ Weight and Thrust ≈ Drag.\\n\\n- How pilots control flight:\\n  - Ailerons control roll (tilting wings left/right) to bank and turn.\\n  - Elevators control pitch (nose up/down) to climb or descend.\\n  - Rudder controls yaw (left/right direction) and coordinated turns.\\n  - Flaps and slats are extra high-lift devices used during takeoff and landing to increase lift at lower speeds.\\n\\n- Stall and safe flight:\\n  - If the wing’s angle of attack gets too high or the plane slows too much, lift drops suddenly (stall).\\n  - Stall can be recovered by lowering the angle of attack and/or adding power to accelerate.\\n\\nA simple way to think about it: when the plane moves fast enough and the wings are tilted appropriately, they generate enough lift to support the weight, while the engines push the plane forward to keep that lift coming as you fly.', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1844, 'prompt_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 1855, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 1408, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_provider': 'openai', 'model_name': 'gpt-5-nano-2025-08-07', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'id': 'chatcmpl-D1wUjPEjhTS6r8e8ymumSocDietNw', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='lc_run--019bf5cf-29a5-7121-8a03-b3caec6a8d23-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 11, 'output_tokens': 1844, 'total_tokens': 1855, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 1408}}))\n"
